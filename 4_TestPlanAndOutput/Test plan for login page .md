## TEST PLANS FOR LOGIN
The test plan contains a detailed understanding of the workflow and functions of the system and documents how each of those will be tested in order to find out if the system works according to its design, to find bugs, and to determine its actual limitations.

***Main login scenarios which were exclusively tested are :***

-check whether the login works with correct credentials.

-check that it doesn't work with wrong credentials.

-check whether password text is hidden.
