# Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
It is a general purpose modelling language ( *visual* ) which are used to portray the behavior and structure of a system.
The main aim of UML is to define a standard way to visualize the way a system has been designed. 
It is quite similar to blueprints used in other fields of engineering.
